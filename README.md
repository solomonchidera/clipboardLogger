# clipboardLogger
A simple clipboard logger script created because of Mac supporting history of one clipboard token at a time, with this script i get to log my clipboard contents every 10mins and log it to a file

it could be adjusted longer or shorter

## ATTENTION - make sure you have the right to try this on the computer you want to try it on

## How to use
[-] clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/solomonchidera/clipboardLogger
```

### Run the bash script
The default location where this logs will be save is in the script, if you want to adjust that or rename it fine

the script creates the folder if not existing already, once you are satisfied with the location and timestamp which could be adjusted

by updating the ``sleep`` command in the script to your choice.

chmod +x cliplogger.sh
```
